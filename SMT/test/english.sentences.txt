i don 't get that feedback in real life .
soon after , when I was walking past a train station ,  I saw something terrible that to this day I can 't erase from my memory .
so with gardening, I see an opportunity  where we can train these kids to take over their communities ,  to have a sustainable life .
in both my vocation at Robin Hood and my avocation as a volunteer firefighter ,  i  am witness to acts of generosity and kindness on a monumental scale , but I 'm also witness to acts of grace and courage on an individual basis .
